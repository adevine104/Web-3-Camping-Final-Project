                                        attracting into wildlife. To prevent unwanted confrontations with an animal, pack your food in tight,

                                        animals. Avoid touching, feeding and getting near wild animals. Watch wild animals from a safe distance in

                                        trees. You should also never leave a fire unattended. Always keep a water bucket nearby and put the fire out
