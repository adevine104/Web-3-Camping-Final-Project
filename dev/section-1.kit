    <h1>Why Camping?</h1>
    <article>
        <p>Anyone you ask has a different reason for camping. Some like to disconnect from technology and reconnect with
            nature. Some families go camping to revitalize their relationships, away from all the distractions at home.
            Many youth organizations teach young people how to build a fire, pitch a tent, or read a compass. Camping means
            different things to different people.</p>
