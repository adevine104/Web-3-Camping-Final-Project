            <h3>Dirt-cheap camping gear that’s actually worth spending your money on</h3>

                <h6>Teton Sports Scout 3400 Backpack ($60)</h6>
                <img src=/Users/nina/Documents/GitHub/Web-3-Camping-Final-Project/deploy/img/section-4/backpack.jpg height="500">
                <p>Your backpack just might be the most important piece of gear you take with you when going camping. After all, it not only has to be comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, it has to carry all of your other gear too. The Teton Sports Scout 3400 provides 55-liters of carrying capacity, comes with a fully-adjustable back panel, and has a well padded hipbelt and shoulder straps. It also features a built-in rain cover to keep all of your gear dry during unexpected storms and has plenty of extra pockets and pouches to help you stay organized. It even has a separate compartment just for holding your sleeping bag and external gear loops for storing trekking poles, ice axes, and other tools.</p>

                <h6>Coleman Sundome Two Person Tent ($27)</h6>
                <img src=/Users/nina/Documents/GitHub/Web-3-Camping-Final-Project/deploy/img/section-4/tent.jpg height="500">
                <p>For those who would still prefer to use a tent as their camp shelter it tough to beat the Coleman Sundome. It not only sleeps two comfortably, but it also comes with a rain fly and features a welded floor and inverted seams to help keep moisture at bay. Large windows provide plenty of ventilation and there is even enough room inside to store your backpacks and extra gear. Set-up reportedly takes less than 10 minutes and when broken down it stores in an included stuff sack for easy transport. All for less than $30.</p>

                <h6>OuterEQ Camping Hammock ($20)</h6>
                <img src=/Users/nina/Documents/GitHub/Web-3-Camping-Final-Project/deploy/img/section-4/hammock.jpg height="500"> 
                <p>Hammock camping is all the rage right now as more and more backpackers discover the joys of sleeping above the cold, damp ground rather than on it. Typically a good hammock will set you back $70 or more, but the Camping Hammock from OuterEQ is priced nicely at just $20. Made from lightweight parachute nylon – the same that is used in far more expensive brands – this hammock is durable, comfortable, and easy to set up, making it a viable alternative to the more well-known options.</p>

                <img src=/Users/nina/Documents/GitHub/Web-3-Camping-Final-Project/deploy/img/section-4/cook.jpg height="600">
                <p>Inspired by Andrew Skurka’s homemade cat food can stove, the Alocs Alcohol Burner Stove takes everything we like about the original and improves on it nicely. This version weighs in at just 4.6 ounces but thanks to its stainless steel and copper construction, it remains highly durable. It also comes equipped with a folding handle and a fire extinguishing lid that makes it easy to handle, even while hot. Fast, efficient, and cheap; what more could you ask for from your camp stove?</p>
