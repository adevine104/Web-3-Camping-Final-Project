     <h3>Camping gear that’s actually worth spending your money on</h3>

             <h6>Teton Sports Scout 3400 Backpack ($60)</h6>
             <img src="img/section-4/backpack.jpg" alt='backpack' height="500">
             <p>Your backpack just might be the most important piece of gear you take with you when going camping. After
                 all, it not only has to be comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, it has to carry all of
                 your other gear too. The Teton Sports Scout 3400 provides 55-liters of carrying capacity, comes with a
                 fully-adjustable back panel, and has a well padded hipbelt and shoulder straps. It also features a
                 built-in rain cover to keep all of your gear dry during unexpected storms and has plenty of extra
                 pockets and pouches to help you stay organized. It even has a separate compartment just for holding
                 your sleeping bag and external gear loops for storing trekking poles, ice axes, and other tools.</p>

             <h6>Coleman Sundome Two Person Tent ($27)</h6>
             <img src="img/section-4/tent.jpg" alt='tent' height="500">
             <p>For those who would still prefer to use a tent as their camp shelter it tough to beat the Coleman
                 Sundome. It not only sleeps two comfortably, but it also comes with a rain fly and features a welded
                 floor and inverted seams to help keep moisture at bay. Large windows provide plenty of ventilation and
                 there is even enough room inside to store your backpacks and extra gear. Set-up reportedly takes less
                 than 10 minutes and when broken down it stores in an included stuff sack for easy transport. All for
                 less than $30.</p>

             <h6>OuterEQ Camping Hammock ($20)</h6>
             <img src="img/section-4/hammock.jpg" alt='hammock' height="500">
             <p>Hammock camping is all the rage right now as more and more backpackers discover the joys of sleeping
                 above the cold, damp ground rather than on it. Typically a good hammock will set you back $70 or more,
                 but the Camping Hammock from OuterEQ is priced nicely at just $20. Made from lightweight parachute
                 nylon – the same that is used in far more expensive brands – this hammock is durable, comfortable, and
                 easy to set up, making it a viable alternative to the more well-known options.</p>

             <h6>Alocs Alcohol Burner Stove ($19)</h6>
             <img src="img/section-4/cook.jpg" alt='cook' height="600">
             <p>Inspired by Andrew Skurka’s homemade cat food can stove, the Alocs Alcohol Burner Stove takes everything
                 we like about the original and improves on it nicely. This version weighs in at just 4.6 ounces but
                 thanks to its stainless steel and copper construction, it remains highly durable. It also comes
                 equipped with a folding handle and a fire extinguishing lid that makes it easy to handle, even while
                 hot. Fast, efficient, and cheap; what more could you ask for from your camp stove?</p>
