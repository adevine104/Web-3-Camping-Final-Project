        <div class="front">Know Your Surrounding</div>
        <div class="back">Look for landmarks at the campsite and on hikes. While hiking, look at the trail to
            familiarize yourselves with your surroundings.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="c2" class="container">
        <div class="front">Pack and Store Food</div>
        <div class="back">Leaving food out on picnic tables or anywhere not secured can increase your chances of
            attracting into wildlife. To prevent unwanted confrontations with an animal, pack your food in tight,
            waterproof containers and store them in an insulated cooler.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="c3" class="container">
        <div class="front">Avoid Wild Animals</div>
        <div class="back">To help keep wild animals away, store all food in sealed containers and out of the reach of
            animals. Avoid touching, feeding and getting near wild animals. Watch wild animals from a safe distance in
            their natural surroundings.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="c4" class="container">
        <div class="front">Know the Weather </div>
        <div class="back">Make sure to keep an eye on the weather forecast before your trip. As we all know, weather can
            change within the hour, which means it’s essential to pack for inclement weather such as rain, snow, and
            high heat and humidity. </div>

    <div id="c5" class="container">
        <div class="front">Campfire Safety</div>
        <div class="back">Fires within your campground site should be at least 15 feet from tent walls, shrubs and
            trees. You should also never leave a fire unattended. Always keep a water bucket nearby and put the fire out
            before leaving or going to sleep.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="c6" class="container">
        <div class="front">Insect Protection</div>
        <div class="back">To protect yourself from mosquitos, ticks and other insects, use insect repellent that doesn’t
            dissolve easily in water. It’s also recommended to wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when hiking to
            avoid direct contact with insects.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="c7" class="container">
        <div class="front">Stay Hydrated</div>
        <div class="back">Staying hydrated doesn’t mean drinking when you’re thirsty — it means drinking water regularly
            throughout the day, even if you don’t think you’re thirsty.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="c8" class="container">
        <div class="front">Clean Camp Site</div>
        <div class="back">While it's good practice to keep your site clean, it's critical to camping safety, too. Dirty
            dishes, leftover trash, or food left in the open could attract animals you don't want to mess with.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="c9" class="container">
        <div class="front">Know Your Plants</div>
        <div class="back">Avoid touching any unknown plants. Any part of your body that comes in contact with a
            poisonous plant should be washed immediately with cool water to help remove the oil that causes the allergic
            reaction. </div>
