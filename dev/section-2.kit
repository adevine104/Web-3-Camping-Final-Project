        clean yourself up! </h3>
    <h3 class="left-side-text">The mosquitos are relentless</h3>
    <h3 class="right-side-text">Try using bug spray or, even better, candles and tiki torches to keep the bugs away and add some flair to your site!</h3>

    <h3 class="right-side-text">Come with the right group of friends and plan activities beforehand like swimming, fishing, and visiting local
        attractions! You can also bring games and things to do like cornhole, a book or speakers to listen to music!</h3>
    <h3 class="left-side-text">It requires too much stuff and is expensive!</h3>
    <h3 class="right-side-text">Take your time and plan what you absolutely need. Be aware of when gear goes on sale, shop at discount stores and
